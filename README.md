# Lemon_Quality_Classification

### Description

This project serves as an exploratory endeavor aimed at investigating the efficacy of texture feature extraction methods, particularly Color Co-occurrence Matrix (CCM) and Haralick texture features, in conjunction with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. The primary objective is to discern which combination of texture features and classification techniques yields optimal performance in distinguishing between good and bad quality lemons.
